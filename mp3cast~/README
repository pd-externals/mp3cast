mp3cast~.dll is a MPEG I Layer III (mp3) streaming external for pd (by Miller 
Puckette) that connects to a SHOUTcast or IceCast server.

To install mp3cast~, follow the steps from INSTALL

	using mp3cast~ external for Pure Data

Open the test-mp3cast~.pd to understand how it works.
In this patch, you must send the messages to mp3cast~ 
in the following order :

1/ password ***** 
2/ icecast | mp3cast
3/ connect host port
4/ pd dsp 1

Parameters sent to mp3cast~ object :

  Sampling Rate (Hz): 
Possible values are 48000, 44100 and 32000. If Pd runs at a different sampling 
rate, LAME will resample the signal. Default value for mp3 sampling rate is Pd's 
sampling rate.

  Bitrate (kbit/s): 
Possible values are 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 
and 320. Default is 224.

  Mode: 
Possible values are 0 (stereo), 1 (joint stereo, the default), 2 (dual channel) 
and 3 (mono).

  Password:
The default is 'pd', can be changed with a message "passwd yourpassword".

  Server:
Use message "connect name_of_your_server.com port" to connect (same as with 
Pd's netsend). 'port' is the number specified in the server's config file. 
Attention (for SHOUTcast users): The actual port number used is one higher! 
Standard would be 8000 resulting in a socket at port 8001!!! Bare this in mind 
when configuring proxys or using mp3cast~ in connection with netsend / 
netreceive. For IceCast, the port number used is the same as specified.

  Outlet:
The outlet outputs an int, 1 if connected to SHOUTcast server, 0 if not. This could 
be used to build an automatic reconnect mechanism.

  Other things:
mp3cast~ prints the current status (connection, login, LAME status) to the pd 
window. To see the current settings, send it a message "print" and mp3 settings 
will be displayed.
Note that changing any mp3 settings will require to disconnect and reconnect again!
This has to be done manually. 

  Known problems:
If you turn off audio processing when you are connected with the server, no data will 
be sent to it. This will make the server disconnect after a certain time ('no data' 
error in server log). mp3cast~ does not recongnise this and attempts to keep on
streaming. To avoid this set 'AutoDumpSourceTime' in the servers config file to a 
fairly high value preventing the server from closing the socket to fast.

ALLOWED QUALITY FACTOR :

    -q <arg>        <arg> = 0...9.  Default  -q 5 
                    -q 0:  Highest quality, very slow 
                    -q 9:  Poor quality, but fast 
    -h              Same as -q 2.   Recommended.
    -f              Same as -q 7.   Fast, ok quality
